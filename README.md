hello sam
welcome to my project
thank you for the lessons!
i had done some python before but forgotten most of it. this practice made me remember a lot

the cal_counter_final file is the main one for most of the project
in it you will find solutions to all of the exercises except the OOP stuff

the other main file is the class_counter
classes are totally new to me so it was interesting and challenging sometimes learning them
i did not have the time to make the code more fancy and fun. all the classes became busy at the same time, and i have french every evening. i did the minimum requirement plus some extra things. hope that's okay
regarding using pandas, numpy, etc. i will be doing a lot of that for the data science course. so i will spend the time getting better at it during that class

there is also a folder for imports, which worked well and are straight forward


if you ask some of the students, i spent a lot of time teaching the beginners the basics of coding like for loops and helping them understand the logic
# cal_counter
